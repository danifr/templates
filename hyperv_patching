Dear OpenStack user, <br /><br />

We are planning to update our Windows servers that host OpenStack virtual machines in order to keep our infrastructure secure and up to date.  <br /><br />

We contacted you because you are registered as the owner or main user of $vmcount of the affected virtual machines in the OpenStack service. <br /><br />

The update may require several server reboots. However to minimize the impact of this operation, your virtual machines will be suspended into a 'Save State'. <br />
The 'Save State' means that its current state (open applications, folders, etc.) will be kept and after the reboot it will be resumed. <br />
The only inconvenience is that virtual machines will not be accessible for approximately 5-10 minutes during each reboot. <br /><br />

All virtual machines are expected to be back by 09:30. <br /><br />

Outage ticket: $otg

Your virtual machines will be affected according to the following schedule: <br /><br />

If you have any questions, please contact the service desk at <a href="http://XXXX.ch/go/RR9B">http://cern.ch/go/RR9B</a>
<br /><br />
                           <p style="margin-left: 100px">Best Regards, Cloud Infrastructure Team</p> <br /><br />
